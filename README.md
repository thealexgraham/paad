# The Procedural Audio Asset Designer (PAAD)
by Alex Graham

Please check out this [demo video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlD6vVK9yk)
My master's thesis for the NYU Music Technology program that PAAD was developed for can be found [here](http://alexgraham.net/paad/graham_paad_thesis.pdf).

## Overview
PAAD is a tool that allows you to design procedural audio assets and easily export them for use in game engines.

Create procedural music and sound effects using the power of the SuperCollider synthesis engine and PAAD's easy to use patch-based interface. With one click, export a fully contained asset that can be easily implemented into a game engine (currently as an FMOD plugin).

PAAD was developed for my Master's thesis at NYU and will be available in the near future. Please contact me for any questions!
